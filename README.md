Day-24

There is no right Solution. Today's topics were Files, Directories, and paths in Python, which was wonderfully explained by Angela Yu.

What did I learn?

Files using

open(filename, mode)
open(), read(), readlines(), write() methods in file.

with open(xyz) as x:
    ...
    ...
Absolute and Relative paths in Python.

Project of the day

Mail Merge using files. You can check out my code. You can also clone and run on a local machine using an IDE.

Conclusion

To conclude, I would thank my instructor for being such a wonderful teacher and for coming up with a beautiful course. I would like to thank MYSELF for being self-motivated throughout the lecture.

Suggestion

All those who can understand English at a fast pace and catch up with what the instructor is trying to convey can choose to watch the video at 1.2x speed which reduces the watch time and meanwhile, you can keep the remaining time for practice.
